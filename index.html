        <p> This Live Motion Detector was created using PoseNet & mljs5 in JavaScript!
            It helps a user prevent intrusions, 
            track movements & analyze patterns of motion! 
            Businesses can also gain valuable information about customer behavior, foot traffic, 
            or occupancy rates!
<br>

I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed making it! 
        <br>

Check out a few poses yourself using the example imagery!
